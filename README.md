# MyFirstRepo
Open your README.md file. This is where you describe your project for others to read and understand. 
save this and git will detect new changes to your repository :)

This inside of your folder should have .git but sometimes it might not if you don't allow for hidden files to be shown. So don't worry if you don't see it.
